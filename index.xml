After ten such drops, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a data table that looks something like this (give or take, given your reaction time)</description>

      <description>Hello! Thanks for stopping by! I&amp;rsquo;m currently a postdoctoral researcher at the NCSA , which is a part of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . I work in the DXL group on the open-source data analysis and visualization code yt .
I received my PhD in physics from the University of Notre Dame , where I used cosmological simulations to study dark energy , the structure of the cosmic web , and the Lyman $\alpha$ Forest under Dr.</description>
