      <description>The Observation Let&amp;rsquo;s say that, for whatever reason, you decide to stand on a very tall (but totally safe) ladder, drop a ball, and time how long the ball takes to hit the ground. Jotting down this height in meters and time in seconds, you climb to another rung on the ladder and repeat the process a couple of more times. After ten such drops, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a data table that looks something like this (give or take, given your reaction time)</description>

      <description>Slope Let&amp;rsquo;s plot $y(x) = x$ Awesome.
That done, let&amp;rsquo;s figure out what the slope of that function is. This provides us with a measure of how steep the line is. Put another way, we&amp;rsquo;re asking, &amp;ldquo;how quickly is $y$ changing when $x$ changes?&amp;rdquo;
We see that we can answer that question by noting that every time we increase $x$ by one unit, $y$ also increases by one unit. This suggests that a natural way to define the slope $s$ is as the rise (i.</description>

      <description>Hello! Thanks for stopping by! I&amp;rsquo;m currently a postdoctoral researcher at the NCSA , which is a part of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . I work in the DXL group on the open-source data analysis and visualization code yt .
I received my PhD in physics from the University of Notre Dame , where I used cosmological simulations to study dark energy , the structure of the cosmic web , and the Lyman $\alpha$ Forest under Dr.</description>
